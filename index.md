Welcome to my digital garden.

This is a collection of notes, ideas, and thoughts that I'm cultivating over time. Unlike a blog with polished posts, a digital garden is a space for learning in public, where ideas can grow and evolve.

## How to Navigate

- **Notes** are organized by topic and linked together
- Look for **Linked References** at the bottom of notes to discover connections
- Notes have growth stages:
  - **Seedling**: New, rough ideas
  - **Budding**: Developing thoughts
  - **Evergreen**: Well-developed, stable notes

Feel free to explore and follow the links that interest you.
