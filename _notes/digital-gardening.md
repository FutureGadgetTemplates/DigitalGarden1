Digital gardening is an approach to creating and sharing knowledge online that emphasizes growth, connection, and imperfection.

## Key Principles

1. **Learning in public** - Share ideas as they develop, not just when they're finished
2. **Bidirectional linking** - Connect ideas to each other to form a web of knowledge
3. **Continuous tending** - Return to notes to update, refine, and expand them
4. **Imperfection is okay** - Not everything needs to be polished

## Growth Stages

Digital gardens often use growth metaphors to indicate how developed a note is:

- **Seedling**: A new, rough idea
- **Budding**: An idea that's developing
- **Evergreen**: A well-developed, stable note
