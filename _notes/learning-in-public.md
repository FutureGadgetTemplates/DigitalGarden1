Learning in public means sharing your learning journey openly, including the mistakes and uncertainties along the way.

## Benefits

- Forces you to clarify your thinking
- Helps others who are learning the same things
- Creates opportunities for feedback and connection
- Builds a record of your growth

## How to Practice

1. Write about what you're learning, even if you're not an expert
2. Share your notes and thoughts (like in [digital-gardening](/notes/digital-gardening))
3. Ask questions publicly
4. Document your process, not just results

## The Uncomfortable Part

Learning in public can feel vulnerable. You're showing work that isn't polished. But this vulnerability is also what makes it valuable - it's authentic and relatable.
