## About This Garden

This is a digital garden - a personal wiki of interconnected notes and ideas. Unlike a traditional blog, these notes are meant to be living documents that grow and change over time.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of notes that are:

- **Non-linear**: Notes link to each other rather than being organized chronologically
- **Evolving**: Content is updated and refined over time
- **Imperfect**: Not everything needs to be polished - rough ideas are welcome
- **Connected**: Ideas build on each other through bidirectional links
